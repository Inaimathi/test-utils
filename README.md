# Test Utils

`:test-utils` provides convenience functions and macros for [:prove](https://github.com/fukamachi/prove) and [:cl-quickcheck](https://github.com/mcandre/cl-quickcheck). Specifically, its aim is to make it simple to use the two together.

Still a work in progress, so no extensive docs yet.
